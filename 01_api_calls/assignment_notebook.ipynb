A black and yellow or black and khaki nylon strap is threaded through the black nylon loop on the anchor strap to form a \"Y.\" On each side of the \"Y,\" the strap has a cam buckle, which is used to adjust the length of the straps. Each end of the \"Y\" strap has a foam-covered hand grip and a foot cradle. The recalled devices have hand grips with no end bumpers, which are black plastic caps covering the ends and preventing the plastic under the foam from being exposed. They do not have an extra nylon loop, called a locking loop, attached at the point where the anchor strap and the \"Y\" straps are joined and designed to limit the slippage of the straps. The recalled products also have badges on the straps with the TRX logo and the word \"Professional\" (for P1 devices) or \"Tactical\" (for T1 devices) on them. The words and logo are surrounded by raised dots or have double lines through them.',\n",

First, while being used in the incline position, the machine\\'s backboard bench can unexpectedly collapse and break, posing a risk of injury to the user. Second, the \"Lat Tower,\" can rotate forward and fall during use, posing a risk of injury to the user. Nautilus Direct and CPSC have received at least 70 reports of the backboard benches breaking, resulting in at least 59 back, neck and shoulder injuries. Nautilus Direct has received at least 18 reports of the \"Lat Tower\" rotating forward and falling, resulting in at least 14 back, neck, shoulder, teeth, nose and head injuries, some of which required stitches. The recalled fitness machines are the Bowflex Power Pro XL, XTL and XTLU systems with the \"Lat Tower\" attachment. The \"Lat Tower\" attaches to the back of the bench, and has pull-down pulleys attached. The name \"Bowflex\" and the model name are printed on the front of the machine. The machine has 10 to 14 resistance rods that extend about 48-inches high and a backboard bench that is about 36-inches long. The recalled fitness machines were made in China, Taiwan and the U.S.A. Infomercials and specialized retail stores nationwide sold the fitness machines from January 1995 through December 2003 for between $1,200 and $1,600.

To operate the exercise equipment, consumers lie on a glideboard that rolls on an inclined track as the user pulls the hand cords. The Total Gym XL home exercise equipment has a double rail system that attaches to a support column at a degree of incline selected by the consumer. A glideboard slides on the rails. The consumer lies on the glideboard and, using a pulley system, pulls the glideboard from the ground to the support column with their own body weight providing the resistance. The recalled exercisers are black and chrome and have 'Total Gym XL' written on the glideboard. Total Gym Fitness LLC sold the exercisers directly to consumers nationwide through television infomercials between January 2002 and February 2002 for about $1,300. PROBLEM: A lever pin that supports the elevated railing of the glideboard could fail, causing the user to fall. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: CPSC and Total Gym Fitness LLC have not received any reports of incidents. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injuries. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should stop using the exerciser immediately and call Total Gym Fitness for a free safety bracket. For more information, consumers should call Total Gym Fitness toll free at (877) 685-1402 between 8:30 a.m. and 11 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. Purchasers were sent direct mail notification of this recall.\",\n",

The machine is designed to close horizontally for easy storage. In the cases of reported injuries, when the handle bar was pulled against the seat during use, the machine unexpectedly closed into the storage position causing injuries. Icon Health & Fitness Inc. has received 15 reports of the exercise machines unexpectedly closing into the storage position during use, resulting in head, back and neck injuries. The Pro Form R-930 Space Saver Riders being recalled have serial numbers beginning with G04, G33, G43, G53, G63, G73, G83, or G93. The model number PFCR64060 and serial numbers are located on a decal underneath the seat frame near the front of the machine. The black metal exercise machine resembles a bicycle without wheels. \"Pro Form R-930...Push Resistance...Pull Resistance\" is written in yellow on each side of the seat frame. \"Space Saver\" is written in gray on top of the seat frame. To operate the machine, the consumer pulls the handle bar toward the body\\'s torso, which in turn raises the seat forward. Two yellow knobs beneath the seat frame can be adjusted manually to increase or decrease resistance for a more or less intense workout. Retail stores nationwide sold the Pro Form R-930 Space Saver Rider from August 1996 through May 1997 for about $250. Consumers should stop using the machine immediately and call Icon Health & Fitness Inc. at (800) 999-3756 between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. MDT Monday through Friday for a free repair kit with installation instructions.

The ends of the elasticized ropes are joined together by metal crimps that may fail in use. Children using the ropes or standing nearby can be hit by an end of the rope as it snaps back. Klutz has received 17 reports of the ropes breaking apart and one report in which a child was struck and scratched near the eye, but did not require medical attention. Klutz is offering to replace all metal crimped ropes with knotted ropes. \"Chinese Jump Rope\" is a colorfully illustrated children\\'s book that describes how to play variations of the popular jump rope game, including \"Doubles,\" \"American Ropes,\" \"Crazy Rope,\" and \"Toothpicks.\" Each book comes with two elastic ropes, one short and the other long. Klutz sold the jump ropes with the activity books directly through its catalog and through major retail book stores as well as many independent gift, toy and book stores nationwide beginning in March 1997 for $10.95. Consumers should take the recalled jump ropes away from children immediately and call Klutz Inc. collect at 415-857-0888 for the free replacement ropes or write to Klutz Inc., 2121 Staunton Court, Palo Alto, CA 94306.

Announce Recall of Exercise Machines WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Stamina Products Inc. of Springfield, Mo., is announcing a voluntary recall to refund or replace approximately 21,500 exercising machines (model PR-6050). The machine\\'s welds may develop cracks or breaks. Consumers could be injured if the welds break and the seat drops unexpectedly. Stamina has received notice of 43 reports of the welds allegedly cracking or separating, resulting in injuries such as sprains and bruises. The black metal exercise machine resembles a bicycle without wheels. \"Stamina\" is printed in red on the back, lower frame of the machine. To operate the machine, consumers pull the handlebars, which rocks the seat forward. The machine adjusts under the seat to increase resistance and provide a more intense workout. QVC Network, Damark International Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and Value Vision sold the PR-6050 from November 1995 through February 1996 for about $99. Consumers who own PR-6050s should immediately contact Stamina to arrange for a refund or free replacement. In order to receive a refund or free replacement, consumers must return the PR-6050 to Stamina at Stamina\\'s cost. For more information, consumers should call Stamina at (800) 375-7520 or write to Stamina at P.O. Box 1071, Springfield, MO 65801-1071.',\n",

Models affected in the repair program are: E130, E131, E131B, E133, E134, and E137. PROBLEM: Weider Sporting Goods, Inc. has received at least 38 reports of minor bruises, cuts, serious lacerations, and partially amputated fingers to consumers using the affected exercise benches. A hazard is created when the user grabs the end support bar and places a finger in the open space between the end bar and leg extension bar. As the user begins exercising and raises the leg extension bar, the space is greatly reduced, causing finger entrapment and injury. WHAT TO DO: Stop using the exercise benches immediately until you receive a replacement cap attachment. A free replacement cap attachment is available directly from the place of purchase or by calling 1-800-685-5480. Consumers may also write to: Weider Sporting Goods, Inc., P.O. Box 68, Olney, IL 62450 to request the replacement cap attachment. WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC, Weider Sporting Goods, Inc., of Woodland Hills, CA, announces that a voluntary repair program for certain E-130 Series Exercise Benches has been implemented. The moving part of the leg extension bar has entrapped consumers' fingers, resulting in serious lacerations and partially amputated fingers. Weider Sporting Goods, Inc. has received at least 38 reports of minor bruises, cuts, serious lacerations, and partially amputated fingers to consumers using the affected exercise benches. While performing the leg extention exercise, a consumer may remove his or her hands from the sides of the bench and grab the top of the leg extension bar. If the user's finger is placed in the open space between the end bar and leg extension bar, it can be trapped when the leg extension bar is raised. This repair program, which was initiated in March 1992, only applies to certain E-130 series benches with right angle leg extensions. Affected model numbers are: E130, E131, E131B, E133, E134 and E137. The benches were distributed from April 1991 through December 1991. Approximately 71,000 units were distributed to retail stores throughout the United States. The exercise benches were sold to consumers for approximately $80 each. To avoid injury, Weider Sporting Goods, Inc. is offering a free replacement cap attachment. Consumers should ensure that the cap is securely snapped into place and is not removed. The cap can be obtained by contacting Weider Customer Service toll- free at 1-800-685-5480. Consumers may also write to: Customer Service, Weider Sporting Goods, Inc., P.O. Box 68, Olney, IL 62450. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this repair program as a part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction\",\n",

PROBLEM: The freely rotating middle bar on the bench press mechanism may cause a user\\'s foot or feet to slip off the press mechanism while doing leg presses. A user may then be struck in the leg and injured as the press mechanism forcefully returns to the \"start\" position. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should discontinue performing the leg press exercise that is outlined in the product\\'s manual. WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Diversified Products of Opelika, AL, previously announced a voluntary repair program for its \"Megaflex Home Exerciser,\" model numbers 15-7500 and 15-7600. The exercise units are easily identified by the label \"Megaflex\" printed across the top of the included exercise bench. The freely rotating middle bar on the bench press mechanism may cause a user\\'s feet to slip off the press mechanism while performing the leg press exercise. A user may then be struck in the leg and injured as the press mechanism forcefully returns to the start position. Consumers who own these exercisers are asked to discontinue performing the leg press exercise that is recommended in the product\\'s manual. The problem was permanently corrected on units manufactured after 1991. Approximately 66,000 of the affected units were sold between February 1991 and January 1992. The units were sold throughout the United States in retail stores at a cost of approximately $400.00. The firm is out of business and the repair kit once offered is no longer available. Again, consumers should discontinue performing the leg press exercise that is recommended in the product\\'s manual. CPSC was informed of this potential hazard by Diversified Products after the firm received several complaints from customers who had sustained injuries while performing the leg press exercise',\n",

              "  'Description': 'FEBRUARY 5, 1992 Release # 92-045 Spring-Type Stomach Exercisers Repair/Recall Program Announced WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Hanover House Industries, Inc., of Hanover, PA, is voluntarily undertaking corrective action programs for two kinds of stomach exercisers: the \"Pull-Up Exerciser\" and the \"Maxi Rower.\" The Pull-Up Exerciser consists of a footrest bar and a handlebar connected with a spring that is pulled or stretched by the user to provide exercise. The Maxi Rower consists of two springs, each attached at one end to a common metal frame, and at the other end to separate handles. The user sits on a rolling seat with feet placed in a footrest that is attached to the frame. Overextending the spring on either product may cause it to break and to separate from the footrest bar or from the handle- bar. Upon separation, the spring and handle can strike the user causing eye injury, broken teeth, bruises, and lacerations to the face, head, groin and other parts of the body. Injuries have also occurred from sharp edges on the footrest bar of the Pull-Up Exerciser when the end plugs of the footrest bar come loose. Injuries, including broken bones, have occurred when the frame of the Maxi Rower tipped or broke causing the user to fall. The Commission learned of the problems with the stomach exercisers from a complaint to the Commission\\'s Consumer Hotline. Hanover House Industries reported 26 incidents associated with the Pull-Up Exerciser (1.5 million sold nationwide, 1981-1988), and 12 incidents with the Maxi Rower (701,365 sold nationwide, 1984-1989). Hanover House Industries is a catalog/mail order company. The program for these products applies only to those purchased by mail-order. Pull-Up Exercisers purchased from Hanover House Industries after 1988, and Maxi-Rowers purchased from Hanover House Industries after 1989, are not included in the program. Hanover House Industries is offering owners of the exercisers covered by the program a free retrofit kit for the Pull-Up Exerciser. It includes a restraining cord that is designed to prevent spring breakage and separation of the handle- bar from the spring. The kit also includes step-by-step assembly instructions that offer directions on how to secure the end plugs to the footrest. Hanover House Industries is offering owners of the Maxi Rower covered by the program who return a spring from the Maxi Rower, a credit for its original purchase price toward the purchase of another of its products. Consumers may obtain (1) the retrofit kit for the Pull-Up Exerciser; or (2) a credit on the Maxi Rower for a future catalog purchase by calling toll-free 1-800-338-2670. Consumers should immediately discontinue using the Pull-Up Exerciser until the retrofit kit is installed. Consumers who do not elect to repair the Pull-Up Exerciser should discard those units so that no one else may use them. Consumers who have the Maxi Rower should save the spring for return to the Hanover House Industries for the merchandise credit, and discard the remainder of those units. CPSC\\'s mission is to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission\\'s objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC\\'s jursidiction',\n",

              "  'Description': \"OCTOBER 8, 1991 Release # 92-004 Schwinn Xr-5 Exercisers Still Need Safety Modification Washington, DC -- Together with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Schwinn Bicycle Company of Chicago, IL is urging consumers who own a Schwinn XR-5 exerciser, manufactured between 1971 and 1977, to take part in a voluntary safety program if that unit was not modified in response to a previous safety notification involving 171,000 units in 1984. The response rate to the earlier program was low; Schwinn subsequently received 10 additional reports of injury, bringing the total number injured to 30. The reports received by Schwinn indicate that unsupervised children and infants have been injured when their fingers or toes got caught in the rear sprocket-chain juncture point on the left side of the XR-5 exerciser, resulting in amputation or other personal injury. There have also been reports of injuries occurring at the front sprocket-chain juncture point on the right side of unmodified units. As the manufacturer of this product, Schwinn is concerned about any type of injury allegedly associated with its products. As a result, Schwinn Bicycle Company is again offering to install or provide, at no charge, a Chainguard Retro Fit Kit that should help prevent potential harm to unsupervised children. If you own an XR-5, make sure small children do not play on or around your XR-5 unit. As indicated in the unit's owner's manual, when the unit is not in use, tighten the tension control knob located on the control panel so the pedals cannot be turned by small children, or place the unit in a locked or secure room. If you own an XR-5 unit which has not been modified, you should immediately make arrangements with your local authorized Schwinn dealer for installation of an XR-5 Chainguard Retro Fit Kit (part #90518). Installation will be done at no charge to the consumer. If you are unable to bring in your XR-5 unit, call Schwinn's Consumer Relations Department at 1-800-633-0231, and they will send you a Chainguard Retro Fit Kit so that you can install it yourself. However, Schwinn recommends that you have your authorized Schwinn dealer make the installation. If you sold or gave away your XR-5 unit, please let the new owner know of this safety program or call 1-800-633-0231 with the name and address of the person who now owns the unit and Schwinn will contact the new owner. For further information, please contact your local authorized Schwinn dealer or call 1-800-633-0231. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this modification program as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to help reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths that are associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction\",\n",

              "  'Description': 'May 14, 1991 Release # 91-065 Safety Recall Announced For Exer-Climber, Promo-Stepper WASHINGTON, DC -- Dynamic Classics, Ltd. of Saddlebrook, NJ, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), announced a free retrofit program for its spring exerciser called either the \"Exer-Climber\" or the \"Promo- Stepper.\" The springs of some 35,000 exercisers sold nationwide from April 1989 through December 1990 may break during use and result in serious foot injuries. The firm has notified CPSC of 82 such injuries. The injuries occurred when the spring broke and part of the spring struck the user\\'s foot, resulting in bruises, lacerations and fractures. The exercisers are a stair-climber type device consisting of two springs, each attached to a black foot pedal and mounted to a metal A-frame. Black or white metal tubular sections and a foam-padded handle are additional parts provided for consumers to assemble the A-frame exercisers. The unassembled products were sold in stores nationwide. The retail price was approximately $45.00. Dynamic Classics is alerting consumers to correct their exercisers with a free retrofit kit being offered by the firm. The kit provides springs with metal brackets on each end to prevent over-stressing and breaking of the end loops of the springs. Exer-Climbers and Promo-Steppers with the metal brackets attached to both ends of the springs do not require the corrective kit. Consumers should immediately discontinue using Exer- Climbers and Promo-Steppers without metal brackets attached to the ends of the springs. The products should not be used until the springs are replaced with the retrofit kit. Consumers should call Dynamic Classics, Ltd. toll-free at 1-800-284-8492 to receive a free retrofit kit. Consumers may also write to: Dynamic Classics, Ltd., 95 Mayhill Street, Saddlebrook, NJ 07662. Consumers who have an exerciser without metal brackets attached to the ends of the springs, and who do not wish to use or repair it should destroy the exerciser so that no one else may use it and risk injury. The exercisers manufactured after June 1990 have been corrected to prevent breakage. The CPSC was established in 1972 as the Federal agency responsible for product safety. The CPSC is commissioned to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. Some 15,000 different kinds of consumer products fall within the Commission\\'s jurisdiction and each year these products are involved in an estimated 29 million injuries and 22,000 deaths',\n",

Sold nationwide between 1981 and 1987 for up to $150 each, the exercise cycles have been involved in at least six finger crushing injuries and amputations to small children caused by contact with wheels, gears and pedal sprockets. Consumers with MCA Model ST-81 exercise cycles, and especially those consumers with small children are urged either to have a chain guard installed that will prevent fingers from contacting moving parts or to discard the product. Also, parents are reminded to keep small children away from exercise bicycles while in use or while unattended. Merchant's Corporation of America has been out of business since the end of 1987, and therefore, is unable to assist with corrective action.

Without boots, these machines may present a risk of crushing the user's foot. These machines are cabinet-style electrically operated exercisers that were sold to commercial health clubs for approximately $300.00 each. The user lies on the machine's padded bed with legs elevated and feet buckled loosely into foot pedals. The Commission investigated one case based on a Freedom of Information Request in which a 28-year-old woman suffered a crushing injury to the back of her foot when her foot fell off the machine's pedal during use and became entrapped in moving gears. The Commission believes that on approximately the first 30 of these Leg Toners manufactured in 1986, an unguarded opening around the base of the foot pedal allows access to moving parts inside the cabinet. Although the manufacturer, which is no longer in business, attempted to retrofit these machines with a protective boot around the base of the pedals, a Commission investigation found that not all of the 30 affected units were retrofitted. Owners of these exercise machines should stop using them if they are not equipped with the protective boot. The CPSC is announcing this warning as a part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks associated with consumer products.

Some two million exercisers of the earlier model were sold nationwide from 1984 to August 1987. Approximately 60 incidents have been reported to CPSC and the firm, most of which involved a broken spring or a footbar assemble coming apart. Consumers have experienced bruises, cuts and lacerations to the face and other parts of the body when the handlebar or spring stuck the user. Incidents showed that the spring of the Rowing Action Exerciser, if extended too far to withstand the stress, could snap. Dynamic Classics is offering owners of the older models a free retrofit kit, which is designed to prevent the spring breaking and the footbar separating. The retrofit kit includes a safety cord to prevent over-stretching and over-stressing the spring, metal brackets to prevent over-stressing the spring loop, and a new extended footbar to prevent separation. Rowing Action Exercisers sold after August 1987 do not need retrofitting. They can be identified by metal brackets already attached to the top and bottom of the spring and a safety cord installed inside the spring. Earlier models had no brackets and a longer safety cord. Consumers should immediately discontinue the use of older models of the Rowing Action Exerciser, which do not have metal brackets attached to both ends of the spring. Consumers should call Dynamic Classics, Ltd. toll-free at 1-800-284-8492 to received a retrofit kit. Consumers may also write to: Dynamic Classics, Ltd., 95 Mayhill Street, Saddle Brook, NJ 07662.

Precor model numbers 718E and 714 are involved. These low impact climbers are largely black and white in color. The model number is printed in red on the center-supporting shaft. They are mechanical devices intended to simulate stair climbing exercises and improve leg strength, flexibility and cardiovascular conditioning. The approximate retail price for model 714 is $399.00 and, for model 718E, $459.00. The climbers use digital readouts to apprise the user of his speed, elapsed time and total steps. CPSC said the red pulley cord and black roller in the center section of the device creates a pinch point and has no finger guard. Precor and CPSC are aware of three incidents of finger amputation or laceration when a child placed a finger between the pulley and the roller during use. CPSC urges all owners of this simulated stair climbing device to contact Precor immediately and obtain free a finger guard repair kit. Consumers may contact their nearest Precor dealer or call toll-free 1-800-662-0606. AMPUTATION RISK PROMPTS REPAIR OF PRECOR \"STAIR CLIMBER\" EXERCISE DEVICE',\n",

The product was sold between October 1986 and June 1987 for a price of $19.95.Acting on consumer reports of more than 700 unconfirmed injuries when the exercise spring broke, Gut Buster has developed a method of repairing the device to reduce chances of the spring breaking and injuring users. In some situations, the spring of the \"Gut Buster\" may be extended too far to withstand the additional stress and could snap. Consumers have allegedly experienced bruises, cuts and lacerations to the face and other parts of the body. Consumers should stop using the exercise device and are instructed to call Gut Buster\\'s toll-free number at 1-800-325-7292 to receive the repair kit. Consumers can also write to Gut Buster at 1400 Raff Road, S.W., Canton, Ohio 44750. Step-by-step instructions will explain how to shorten and retie the safety cord that runs the entire inside length of the exercise spring. Consumers not wishing to repair the device should discard the \"Gut Buster\" so no one else may use it',\n",

(Oct. 19) -- Beacon Enterprises, Inc., of Yonkers, N.Y., is conducting a program to replace the seat-attachment hardware on more than 120,000 stationary exercise bikes because of reports that some customers failed to follow the assembly instructions properly and were seriously injured when the metal seat post unexpectedly broke through the seat. The manufacturer, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, announced that the voluntary recall involves units of its Scandia model 462 dual-action cycler built between August 1976 and July 1980. The bikes were sold under the Beacon name through catalogs of major merchandisers including Montgomery Ward and Alden's, and at a number of retail stores nationwide, Some units also were sold through catalogs of Sears, Roebuck and Co, under the Sears name as model 2930. Retail prices ranged from about $20 to $30. No exercise bikes other than Beacon's Scandia model 462 or the Sears model 2930 are involved in the recall. Beacon and the CPSC warn that if customers ignore the products assembly instructions and neglect to secure the seat with a bolt and nut supplied in the parts bag accompanying each bike, the unit's plastic seat may be punctured by the seat post. The CPSC said that no reports of injury were received when the bikes were properly assembled. According to the CPSC, six injuries were reported between 1979 and 1981. No injuries were reported from bikes sold by Alden's or Sears. As part of its voluntary program, the manufacturer is providing a free replacement kit consisting of a bolt, lock washer, nut, warning decal, and instructions for attaching the seat. The kit also tells customers how to look for signs of possible seat failure, The CPSC said that design changes for the seat mount which the company made starting in August 1980 limit the recall to units manufactured before that date. Exercise bikes built after August 1980 bear orange-red decals on the seat tops. The agency said that owners of units without the seat bolt and nut in place should stop using them and contact the manufacturer. Owners of units with the bolt and nut in place should make sure that the nut is secured tightly. Beacon has established a 24-hour telephone service to provide full information about the product and to take orders for the free replacement kits. Consumers are urged to call 212-683-9288 collect for further details about the recall.\",\n",

This is because clean values has an entry for each value of the variable, including multiple values for some instances. For example, Samsung Galaxy Note 7's are manufactured in both South Korea and China, so the clean_values list has an extra entry when compared to the original list that stores both manufacturers at the same index.

        "- CDC WONDER API for Data Query Web Service: Includes death certificates with causes since approximately the 1990's.\n",
        "- Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS): Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains an API that provides Census data on housing problems and needs unavailable through other sources, including IPUMS.\n",
        "- Federal Election Commission API: Provides historical and up to the minute campaign finance data.\n",
        "- Toxic Release Inventory: Provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, this API documents the release and management of over 800 toxic substances, reported annually by privately owned facilities and the government.\n",
        "- Petroleum Data, Prices: Provides prices of petroleum products and crude oil at weekly, monthly, and yearly time scales.\n",
        "- Fair Market Rents Lookup tool: Fair Market Rents (FMRs) determine the value of housing vouchers for Section 8 renters. This API provides the FMR values and other measures of housing affordability.\n",
        "- Annual Economic Surveys, Business Patterns: Surveys of businesses at the zip code level, tracking economic sentiment and activity.\n",
        "- Food Access Research Atlas: Provides spatial data on food access and the availability of supermarkets within census tracts. Can be merged with census data to look at under-served populations and food deserts.\n",
        "- National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration: Provides API access to data on real time weather and climate change projections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these API resources could either be the cornerstone of a project or a source of additional data. These data sources have a number of advantages: They're free, most of them can be accessed using the same API key, and most have similar documentation for how to write a query. This is ideal for students to iterate, experiment, and take risks, with little cost to failure.\n",

        "In addition to government data, many commerical apps provide API access to developers and researchers. AirBnB, Amazon, Reddit, eBay, X, and many others maintain API access to develop third-party apps. These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Pick an API, download some data, wrangle them, and produce some EDA results, as we did in the previous steps with the saferproducts.gov API; or, if you can't get it to work, document why. If you have the time and it's low cost, push the results to a streamlit page. If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
